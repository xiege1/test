Implementation Considerations:
1. Database: Choose a suitable database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and design the schema based on the data fields. 
2. Framework: Consider using a Java framework like Spring Boot to simplify development and provide built-in features for REST API development. 
3. Data Validation: Implement robust validation to ensure data integrity. 
4. Error Handling: Provide meaningful error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes. 
5. Security: Implement authentication and authorization to protect the API. 
6. Documentation: Document the API endpoints and their usage clearly using tools like Swagger or Postman.
